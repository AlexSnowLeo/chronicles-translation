Take the letters to Queen Allison and all the flowery speech.  In my experience, I have never needed more than a sentence to get my point across, but these Erathians and their Knights are always so concerned with politeness and properness it takes them ten times as long to say what they mean.\n\nOf course, there is one time when a Knight shows his Barbarian blood - when he comes in contact with beer.

I felt the rage hot beneath my skin like a fire that couldn't be put out no matter how much blood I spilled, no matter how many villages I razed.\n\nThen I'm standing alone, here in the Underworld amid a field of bones, and I can hear the silent screams of every skull.  Screams for help.  Screams of the innocent I killed.\n\nI clap my hands over my ears and shout, \"I was wrong!  I was wrong!

It didn't hurt, of course, but it startled me.  Who did she think she was?  Her hand flashed toward my face now, but I caught it, gripped it a little too hard.

My horse had been cut from underneath me and I was fighting hand-to-hand with Golems, Gargoyles and Wizards.  I saw a pack of Gremlins swarm Hardac, yet he stood his ground even with a wound in the side.  He knew he was dead, but refused to retreat.\n\nSo, I hacked my way through to save his life.  I carried Hardac back to our healers and returned to the fighting.  Somehow, we pulled off a victory that day, but at a great loss.

Lure the Nagas out, draw them away from the Mages, and then attack.\"\n\nI swallowed my pride and took Hardac's advice, and it's a good thing because the very next day we were ambushed and we only survived because we didn't take many losses against the Nagas.

So, when the bards were captured I knew it was over if they were killed.\n\nYes, I raised a force and broke the wall of Kurl's Tower.  We dominated his army - the courtyard was red with the blood of the Mages.  I reached Kurl's private chambers only to find him cowering there, begging for his life.  And here's where the dream veered from the memory.  Instead of letting him go, I showed him no mercy.  I slaughtered him on the spot because hanging from the trees in Kurl's private garden were four figures swaying in the wind.  The bards - dead.\n\nOur history was lost - forever changed.

I noticed it the first time we met, something about her mannerisms, or maybe the way she talks?  Or could it be her fiery red hair?

Apparently, there is no way to reach his primary fortress from this level of the Underworld, yet he has a One-way Monolith that can bring his troops here.  We will never be able to defeat him completely.\n\nSo, I suppressed that information, otherwise the men will think our fight here is futile.  Finding the Pendant remains my primary goal.",
	"map.hc2_main:5.event.13.description" : "Another evening around the campfire, and perhaps a few too many ales, brought down my defenses last night.  Foolish of me, I know, since I have become the subject of Mensor's recent suspicions.\n\n\"Who trained you to be a Knight, Sir Tarnum?\"  Mensor asked.\n\nIt was a difficult question to answer.  If I named someone who was either still alive or had trained one of those present then I'd be exposed as a liar.  But after Mensor's last probing question, I prepared myself for more.  Luckily, this was one I already considered.\n\n\"Why, Sir Thandos did.  I was devastated when he died.  He was an excellent Knight and served Rion Gryphonheart well.\"\n\nMy choice was a good one.  Sir Thandos was known as something of an eccentric and a recluse, but he was in the King's favor since he had once saved Gryphonheart's life.  I already knew that no one in my army had been trained under the man.\n\n\"Let us toast Sir Thandos and his glorious deeds!\"  I shouted, raising my tankard.\n\nThe men all shouted in unison, \"Here, here!\"",
	"map.hc2_main:5.event.14.description" : "Mensor must suspect that I am not who I claim to be.  I don't blame him for his paranoia - I just wish it wasn't aimed at me.  What if he figured out that I am Tarnum the Barbarian King?  To these people, I am like a child's nightmare.  All they know about me is I am the greatest evil of their recent past.\n\nBut the fact that I should be dead must be throwing Mensor off.  He suspects something, but how could I be someone who is dead?  I just hope he gives up before he realizes that it is not so impossible for a man to return from death.",
	"map.hc2_main:5.event.15.description" : "I often slip out alone to think.  Yes, it's a risk but my sword arm has only failed me once.  Besides, I'm immortal.  This time, however, I spotted Mensor sneaking among the rocks so I followed him.\n\nMensor's clandestine meeting was with an Erathian Knight, not a Demon as I was beginning to believe.  Why else would he be sneaking out here alone?\n\nI didn't recognize the man, but I suspected he was part of Queen Allison's troops.  Using my Barbarian hunting skills, I managed to get close enough to hear the end of their conversation.\n\n\"Are you sure?\"  That was Mensor.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the other.  \"My father never had a squire named Tarnum.  He took only two squires in his entire life.  I was one, and my brother was the other.\"\n\nBlast!  I messed up.  The Knight must be the son of Sir Thandos.  My first instinct was to kill the two men - to silence them forever.  But I can't.  For all the trouble they're causing me, they were not bad men.",

I've received several letters from Knights claiming she is ready to be knighted, but that she won't let anyone but me give her such an honor.\n\nIt's time.  I quickly compose a letter asking Allison to pass command to her most trusted captain and join me as soon as she can.\n\nHer confidence in me has only made me realize that I have sat idle too long about this matter with Mensor.  Something must be done.  If I had confronted him from the beginning, perhaps it wouldn't be so bad now.",

I nodded and dismissed the other Captains, knowing that this was the confrontation I had been dreading.\n\n\"Maybe I should call you King Tarnum, the Tyrant?\" Mensor said.  No reason denying it now.\n\n\"Yes, I was once the Barbarian King.  I didn't set out to be a tyrant though.  Before I knew it, I had become exactly what I set out to battle.  Things happened that I...\"\n\n\"Don't give me pathetic excuses!  How is it you're alive, walking around, and no older than when you supposedly died, if my figures are right?  What are you, a Lich?  Some kind of unnatural?  What kind of beast are you?\"\n\n\"A man, like you,\" I said.\n\n\"Not like me!  You're a murderer!\"\n\n\"Quiet!\" I hushed him.  He had shouted that last part loud enough for everyone to hear.\n\n\"Tell a single soul and you'll kill us all,\" I warned him. \"My actions speak for themselves.  I've gotten us this far, but now is not the time for everything to fall apart.  You know as well as I that we are committed to this quest.  No turning back now.  I am here because I want to help Queen Allison.\n\nIf you don't want to hear my story, fine.  But if you try to expose my secret, you'll learn what a tyrant I can truly be.

	"map.hc2_main:5.event.21.description" : "I gave Mensor and myself a couple days to cool off, then I summoned him to my tent.  When he entered, he stared at me, open hatred in his eyes.  I'd seen worse, but I also knew by his cautious stance that he was plotting my assassination.\n\n\"Mensor, maybe you'll never believe that I truly am on your side.  I'm here to help Queen Allison - that's all.  When I'm done, you'll never see me again.  But until you believe me, I've decided that I have to play your game for the sake of all these men\"\n\nA look of uncertainty flickered across his face.\n\n\"I have a piece of information that would not only bring down Queen Allison, but the Kingdom of Erathia as well.  Knowing how much you care for your people, you'll not want to risk this secret getting out.  Especially if, say, I were to mysteriously die, and then a loyal soldier with orders to take a certain letter to the upper world and give it to the first minstrel he finds.  Minstrels are notoriously bad at keeping secrets, you know.\"\n\n\"What secret?\" Mensor asked hesitantly.  This was the game he was used to playing, and he could tell that I was not bluffing. ",
	"map.hc2_main:5.event.22.description" : "Mensor has been cold toward me for some time now, but as least no one has attempted to put a dagger in my back.  He's returned to his work with a vengeance, but now he only sends his reports in written form.\n\nWhen we first started working together I got the impression he liked me, and I certainly liked him. My attempts to explain myself have been met with polite refusals.  Mensor simply doesn't want to talk to me, and I suspect there is a deeper reason for such hatred.",
	"map.hc2_main:5.event.23.description" : "Pit Fiends swept through the camp last night.  They burned supplies and spoiled much of our food.  By the time I reached the commotion, I saw Mensor fighting a losing battle with one of the enemy.  He's a better spy than swordsman.  I pushed my way to Mensor's side just as he tripped over one of the bodies, then I killed the Pit Fiend looming over Mensor.  The rest of the ambushers were dead in minutes.\n\nWhen the combat was over, I met Mensor's gaze but he said nothing.  His wounds were still minor, but I sent him to the healer to have them treated.",
	"map.hc2_main:5.event.24.description" : "\"Tarnum, why did you save me?\"  Mensor's question was direct, asked the instant he stepped into my tent. \n\n\"Because you were in trouble.  It's what friends do for each other,\" I said matter-of-factly.  I wasn't in the mood to deal with this man's anger, so I turned my attention back to sharpening my sword.\n\n\"Your secret could've been safe with me dead?\"\n\n\"Uh, huh.\"\n\nMensor shook his head and left.",
	"map.hc2_main:5.event.25.description" : "Finally, last night Mensor showed up at my tent with a tankard of ale and two mugs.  He filled them to the brim and sat.\n\nI looked at the amber liquid in my cup and smiled, \"Wouldn't be poisoned, would it?\"\n\nAnd I drank it down before Mensor could reply, showing him that I trusted him despite our disagreement.\n\n\"I'm ready to hear your story, Tarnum,\" Mensor said softly.  He took a large gulp too.\n\n\"Fine.  I'll tell you everything, but I want you to know right now that I'm making no excuses.  I did the crimes you hate me for.  Just like I'm no longer the Barbarian Tyrant, nor was I the tyrant in the beginning.  In fact, I was a simple herder barely surviving in a harsh land...\"",
	"map.hc2_main:5.event.26.description" : "It's been a few days since I told Mensor about my long life.  Quiet days.\n\nThen he rode up next to me this morning and said, \"I've heard stories about your death.  King Gryphonheart's wife, your sister, wept for days, and when she couldn't be consoled Gryphonheart returned to the battlefield to recover your body.  Of course, he didn't find it, but he assumed some of your own kind carried it away to some secret place.  The Queen honored you, even though you were our enemy.\"\n\nTears were already flowing down my cheeks.\n\n\"I thought you would like to know that she forgave you,\" Mensor said.  \"I can't forgive the Barbarian King - many of my bloodline were killed by your armies.\"\n\nSo, that's why he hated me so much.  I'm responsible for the deaths of several of his family members.\n\n\"But I can forgive you,\" Mensor continued with some effort.  \"You're a different person now - I can see that.\"\n\nMensor extended his hand in friendship and I accepted it gladly.",

I wonder what would happen if everyone found out that Queen Allison is the niece of Tarnum the Barbarian Tyrant?  Mayhem, I would think.  Certainly, Allison would lose her head.  Everything I have said can be confirmed, you know I'm not lying.\"\n\nMensor left the tent, stunned and confused.

But these caverns are too vast for me to find the Pendant by myself.\n\nSo, I confided in Mensor, certain that the man will keep this information confidential.  When you need a devious plan, leave it up to a good spy.  Since we'll be searching for something anyway, Mensor is going to let it slip to the soldiers that we're looking for an artifact of great power that will help us locate Rion Gryphonheart's soul.  To support this rumor, I am to order the men to report the discovery of ANY magical item they find, and that rewards will be given to those who do.\n\nAn excellent plan, and it's not even a lie - not entirely.",

Is she all right?\"\n\n\"She led us to victory, Sir Tarnum!\"  That was a relief to hear.\n\n\"It was like fighting beside her father again,\" the messenger says proudly.  \"She held back the charge of the Champions even when they protested.  The Marksmen held their attacks as well, until the Minotaurs came within range.  Then the Queen released the full power of the Marksmen.   Many of the enemy died in that exchanged, so she used the Champions to harass them further, charging then fleeing.  By the time the Minotaurs reached our lines, there were too few to mount an effective offense.\"\n\nI smile proudly at my student's success and say, \"Return to the Queen and tell her that I am very impressed.

Who knows what happened to Mensor?  Probably dead as well.\n\nWhat bothers me most is Allison's capture.  I never should've let her agree to command Deezelisk's demon army in our battle against Jorm.  They turned on her when I was distracted with Jorm and spirited her away to Deezelisk.  I should've realized earlier than Jorm was never powerful enough to control so many demons in the Underworld.  All our troubles, all our endless battles in this dark land must have been carefully orchestrated by Duke Deezelisk himself.\n\nI was attacked too, but the demons didn't realize I was immortal.  I managed to slip away after they believed I was dead, and I returned to a Castle in one of the upper levels.

To keep Deezelisk from escaping, some of the ex-slaves who dwell on this layer built a guard post before the Subterranean Gate.

I'll make Deezelisk pay for every day he touched her!\" I said.\n\nMy words seem to give Gryphonheart some courage.  He even smiles.\n\n\"I recognize that tone, Tarnum.

I realize that now.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I said.  He was making little sense.\n\n\"I was the bait, Tarnum,\" Gryphonheart said.  \"Deezelisk ordered Jorm to kidnap me from Paradise so he could lure Allison down here.  Allison's dream wasn't my cry for help - that was the work of Deezelisk.  He knew if he tortured Allison, I would join with her soul to protect her, then he'd finally be able to destroy me.\"\n\n\"Then he manipulated us from the beginning?\"\n\n\"Yes, and he's winning.  I don't know how much longer I can last.  When my soul becomes too weak, it will fade into nothingness - and then Allison will be alone with that cursed Demon!\"\n\nI reach out to place a comforting hand on Gryphonheart's shoulder before I remember that he is no more solid than a soft breeze.\n\n\"There is one thing Deezelisk didn't plan on.\"\n\n\"What?\" Gryphonheart said.\n\n\"Me!\"",

My blind vengeance against the Bracaduun Wizards only disgraced me into my present state as the Immortal Hero.

I met the Storm Elementals head on with nothing but my quarterstaff.

They will do whatever you want them to do whenever you tell them to do it!\"\n\n\"Yeah, Prolific...\"\n\n\"PON-IFIC, lord.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but they don't do EVERYTHING you ask them to do.  I ordered one to breathe but its head cracked open trying to get its small mind around that one,\" I said.\n\n\"Lord, that is quite impossible,\" Ponific said, annoyed and confused at the same time.\n\n\"Fine, forget the breathing,\" I said, grinning as I wondered how far this Wizard could be pushed.\n\n\"Can you make them blink?\"\n",

I have traveled far already, and I have noticed that Water and Ice Elementals block just about every passage in this realm.  They will attack without question, so I have stayed away from them thus far.  You may want to have one Hero deal with these creatures while another picks up the floating debris.  There is a veritable fortune floating on the water!  I have sent some of what I have collected.\"\n\nI looked around, not sure what Barsolar meant.

This wet world is their home, and they are simply defending it for their master.  That, I can understand.  Even respect.  But they stand in the way of my return home.

I haven't felt well enough to wash, not that it's a concern of mine.  A little dirt never hurt anyone.\n\nBut this morning as I mounted, I noticed out of the corner of my eye two Mages snickering and pointing at me.

I even recognize the symbols there at the bottom - it belonged to a famous Wizard who disappeared almost two hundred years ago.\"\n\n\"What's it doing here then?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well, the story goes that a group of powerful Mages wanted to create the ultimate Golem, so they tried to find passage to the Plane of Earth, where they could possibly find the hardest substance in the universe.  Many believe they died when they cast the spell - appeared at the bottom of the ocean or something - but others think they made it to the Plane of Earth but couldn't find a way back.\"\n\n\"That sounds familiar,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes.  It doesn't matter, since this happened two hundred years ago - they'd all be dead by now,\" Barsolar said.\n\n\"Unfortunate.  We could've used the help.\"\n",

If these men actually don't realize how long they've been away, blurting it out was not the way to tell them.  \"How did you survive?\"\n\nReamus explained that they constructed Golems as their soldiers - two guards for each Mage.  Whenever one of the Golems was destroyed, they just made another.  Unfortunately, they had not yet discovered a way to make the ultimate Golem.\n",

So did Ponific and the others.  Only Barsolar seemed to have an idea, if his serious expression was any indication.\n\n\"What is it, Barsolar?\" I asked.  He had been studying these Elemental Planes even as he explored them.\n\n\"It would take some experiments to test my theory, Lord Tarnum,\" Barsolar said noncommittally.\n\n\"I don't care about experiments, Barsolar!  I want answers - even if you're not sure.  What's going on here?\"\n\n\"Time, Lord Tarnum.  The Elemental Planes are fundamentally different from our world.  It would make sense that Time, too, would work differently here,\" Barsolar said.\n\nThe other Wizards all nodded as they began to follow their colleague's path of thought.\n\n\"So,\" I said, \"are you telling me that everything moves slower here than in our world?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Or you could say Time moves quicker in our world.  Either way, two hundred years in our world is equivalent to sixteen here.

Even paper doesn't burn, unless...\"\n\nBarsolar pulled a sheet of parchment from his robes, curled it into a tube, and held it above the flames licking at his feet.  At first, nothing happened.  Then it caught fire so quickly Barsolar had to toss the paper away before it burned his fingers.\n\n\"How did you do that?\" I asked.\n\n\"The fire reacts to your thoughts.

Besides, it moved too smoothly to be walking.\n\n\"What?\" I said.\n\nBut then it dawned on me, a creature that reads the thoughts of everyone around it would already know if someone were lying to them.  Of course it didn't understand trust.  It didn't need it.\n\nYES, NOW I KNOW SOME OF WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT.  HOW DO YOU CREATURES DO IT?\n\n\"You said you already know why we contacted you.  Can you help us battle the Elemental Lords?\" I asked.\n\nWE CANNOT, NOT WITHOUT PERMISSION FROM THE FIRST.\n\n\"The First?\"\n\nYOU WOULD CALL THEM OUR LEADERS.

	"map.hc3_main:5.event.10.description" : "This morning, before any of my advisors woke, I placed a table in the middle of camp and waited.  Soon, a crowd gathered around the table.  All knew this was going to be an important meeting.  I wasn't a fool.  I knew now that my decision to return to the Plane of Fire and save the Phoenixes had divided my forces.  Some, such as the Gremlins and Genies, sided with me, but the Mages wanted to stay here in the Plane of Magic.\n\nThe word spread quickly through camp, and soon my advisors poured from their tents and sat down at the table.  I noticed that Hemoross wouldn't meet my gaze.  Reamus looked concerned.\n\n\"Everyone knows I want to return to the Plane of Fire.  My decision has caused some problems here in camp.  I want to know if your resistance to save the Phoenixes is a selfish desire to study this Plane of Magic, or some other motivation,\" I said.\n\nThe others looked at their hands, the table, anything but my stern face.  Only Reamus was brave enough to speak.\n\n\"It's a matter of urgency, Lord Tarnum.  We know we need the help of the Magic Elementals to defeat the Elemental Lords.  The Magic Elementals will be available to us for a limited time.  However, the Phoenixes will still be the prisoners of the Fire Lord,\" Reamus said.  I couldn't argue with his logic, which only upset me more.  Since when did I start letting logic rule my decisions?\n\n\"So, Reamus, you want to let the Phoenixes suffer more while we hunt for the Magic Elementals, is that right?\"\n\n\"To save the world, yes!\" Reamus said.\n\nI found myself agreeing with the man despite myself, but I was still too angry to leave without striking a few blows of my own.\n\n\"Very well, we'll let the Phoenixes suffer their enslavement for a while longer,\" I said.  \"How easily Wizards accept enslavement.  Not much has changed since the time of Bracaduun when you tried to destroy the Barbarian people.  Did you find real slaves too unpredictable?  Is that why you create these mindless Golems?\"\n\nI got up from the table before anyone could answer.",

Until now, I never cared if these magic users liked me, but I was going to have a major problem if they ceased obeying me.  Especially during combat.  I needed to rely on them, as they needed to rely on me.\n\nNormally, I would bring such a problem up to the Mage Instructor, Hemoross, but lately I've gotten the idea that he doesn't want to talk to me.  It seems that even though I've decided to remain here in the Plane of Magic, I've made some enemies.",
	"map.hc3_main:5.event.12.description" : "The camp is filled with whispers each night, except when I'm around.  That's when everyone becomes deathly quiet as if I was the one they had been talking about.  I'm convinced something is going on.  And I'm afraid this is the sort of conspiracy that usually ends in death.\n\nLast night, after dinner, I returned to my tent because no one seemed in the mood to talk.  I wasn't about to sit around and do nothing about the secrets flying through my camp, but I couldn't strong-arm the men into talking.  These Wizards already disliked my tactics.\n\nSo, I resorted to magic.  I've had control over Air Magic for some time now, so it was easy for me make the air around the camp thinner.  Then I grabbed the vibrations of even the softest sound and directed them toward my own ear.  Suddenly, I was able to hear the conversations of every person in camp as if they were standing right next to me.\n\nFirst, I found Reamus mumbling to himself about elemental magic.  He was alone, so I searched out another familiar voice.  I smiled.  Sometimes, magic had its uses.\n\n\"I'm not so sure that's wise,\" said Ponific hesitantly.  \"I mean, he's managed to get us this far, hasn't he?\"\n\n\"Fool!  He doesn't care about a single one of us.  He's leading us all to our deaths, I tell you.  Listen to his own words - he despises Wizards!  He's a Barbarian, I say!\"\n\nI was certain this last voice belonged to Hemoross, the Mage Instructor.\n\n\"Don't be silly!  He's the best Wizard I've seen, maybe even as good as Gavin Magnus.  No Barbarian spy could do that!\"\n\n\"Look at him!  He's as much said so himself - he hates Wizards!  You'll see, and you'll be sorry!\"\n\nMost of the other whispered conversations in camp were about me.  Nearly everyone suspected that I was a Barbarian spy determined to bring about the downfall of King Magnus.  Some even claimed I got us lost on the Elemental Planes on purpose.\n\nI ended my spell and took a drink of wine.  I hadn't realized it had gotten this bad.",
	"map.hc3_main:5.event.13.description" : "This morning, Hemoross made his move.  Before we had a chance to have a bite to eat, he stood up and demanded everyone's attention.\n\n\"I believe we should have a change in command,\" he said, \"and I think we will all agree that Reamus is the likely choice since Barsolar is not present.\"\n\nI immediately looked at Reamus, who had nearly choked on his tea.  At least Reamus wasn't in on this.  So, Hemoross was the instigator, but how much support did he have?  I had to know.\n\nComing to my feet, I said, \"You do realize, Hemoross, this is not a democracy.  I'm not going to take a vote!\"\n\n\"We don't want you as our leader anymore!  We want someone who is going to get us home safely.  If need be, we can remove you of your command.\"\n\n\"Oh, really?  Who exactly is going to do that?\"\n\nHemoross looked around at the faces of the Wizards gathered here.  Several were prepared to help him, but the others seemed uncertain.\n\n\"So, Hemoross, what are you going to do if I refuse to step down?  How far are you willing to go?\"\n\nI had to know, but a familiar sharp voice said, \"Hold on!\"\n\nIt was Barsolar, returning from the wild as I had asked.  I just hoped it wasn't a mistake.  Barsolar and I had never been on good terms, but at least it seemed we shared the same goal.  He would have to realize that Hemoross's actions would hurt our chances of defeating the Elemental Lords.\n\n\"Sit down, Hemoross, and stop this foolishness,\" Barsolar ordered.  He assumed the role of the King's cousin even though he was dressed in dirty, plain robes.\n\n\"None of us would still be alive if not for the leadership of this man, of Lord Tarnum!  I happen to know that King Magnus wanted Tarnum to lead this quest because Tarnum is skilled both in the tactics of war and magic.  He's our best chance at defeating the Elemental Lords!\"\n\nI was surprised by Barsolar's passionate defense.  He pretended that it had been the idea of Gavin Magnus to make me leader all along, and that they should trust their king's wisdom.\n\n\"And King Magnus will certainly learn about the pitiful way some of you have behaved,\" Barsolar said, staring directly at Hemoross.  Finally, the Mage Instructor sat down.\n",
	"map.hc3_main:5.event.14.description" : "Perhaps I am partially to blame for what happened this morning.  I treated Hemoross and the others poorly when I first became their commander.  Apparently, he never forgave me.  Nor did he forgive Barsolar for supporting me when Hemoross tried to take over.\n\nThat's why Hemoross attacked Barsolar.  The Mage Instructor called Barsolar from his tent and challenged him to a Wizard's duel.  I heard this and stormed out just in time to see Hemoross throw a crackling Lightning Bolt at Barsolar, who stood his ground.  The bolt never hit him, but deflected off an invisible shield and struck the ground instead.\n\n\"I've learned a few things while exploring the Plane of Magic,\" Barsolar said.\n\nThat's when I noticed a few of Hemoross's students sneaking around behind Barsolar.  They raised their hands to cast a spell, so I jumped into the duel.  Back to back, Barsolar and I faced the traitors.  I cast Frost Ring, followed immediately by a Fireball.  The Mages never had a chance.\n\nBehind me, Barsolar and Hemoross exchanged lightning bolts.  Hemoross must've realized he was no match for either of us, so he began to retreat.  I cast Slow on the man so he couldn't get away.  And then it was over.\n\n\"I yield!\" Hemoross shouted.\n\nBarsolar collapsed onto one knee, clutching a shoulder that still smoked from where he was struck by one of Lightning Bolts.\n\n\"Healer!\" I called, and then approached the Mage Instructor.\n\nTo Hemoross, I said, \"Not too bad for a Barbarian, eh?\"",
	"map.hc3_main:5.event.15.description" : "Soon, I am told, we will find the Magic Elementals and we will be able to return to the Plane of Fire to free the Phoenixes.  But I wonder if my army will be able to hold together for that long.  What about afterward?  I suspect many of the Mages hate me because I keep Hemoross locked up in a cage with Iron Golems as guards.\n\nHemoross caused a lot of damage before he tried to kill Barsolar.  His words planted seeds of doubt in the minds of my men.  That could prove fatal for us all.",
	"map.hc3_main:5.event.2.description" : "I was having breakfast, trying to ignore the Pixies as they flitted through the air over the camp, giggling and shrieking as they played some childish game.  One of them dropped low to avoid being tagged by one of the others and the Pixie's foot knocked over my bowl of oatmeal.  My angry shout put an end to the game.  I stood, scraping heavy globs of my morning meal from my robe.\n\n\"Blasted Pixies!\" I yelled.  \"Find somewhere else to play, or by the Ancestors, I'm going to blow off your wings with a lightning bolt!\"\n\nThe Pixies fled as I strolled back to my tent to change my clothes.",
	"map.hc3_main:5.event.3.description" : "For some reason, Hemoross followed me into my tent.  The moment I saw his gloating smile, I wanted to slap him.\n\n\"What is it?\" I barked.\n\n\"My, you have changed since you first took command,\" Hemoross said.  \"Your beard is neatly trimmed, and I heard you took a bath this morning.  Now, you're fussing over a dirty robe!\"\n\nI stared at myself, realizing to my shame that Hemoross was right.  I had become one of them.  I was a Wizard!  If not for my size, a stranger would never suspect that I used to be a Barbarian.  I tore off the stained robe and threw it at the Mage Instructor.\n\n\"Do something useful and have that cleaned!\" I snapped.\n\nHemoross laughed as he exited the tent; too pleased with his own victory to be insulted.\n",
	"map.hc3_main:5.event.4.description" : "A few days ago, Barsolar departed to study and explore this odd realm.  I doubt I could've forced him to stay even if I chained him to one of the Golems.  Well, he's proven useful in the past, so I've asked him to keep an eye on the armies of the Elemental Lords for me.",
	"map.hc3_main:5.event.5.description" : "Barsolar's owl arrived this morning.  I guess even a Barbarian can get used to magical things such as talking owls if he's been exposed to it long enough.  As the owl began its report, I leaned back and listened as if I were talking to a normal messenger.\n\n\"Luck is with us, Lord Tarnum,\" the owl said in Barsolar's nasal voice.  \"These Elementals hate each other almost as much as they hate us.  They fight with each other.  They think that if one of them reaches the Magic Elementals first, they will be able to destroy the other elements as well as our own world.\"\n\nI hadn't expected good news this morning.  My enemy would be easier to deal with as long as they weren't unified. \n",
	"map.hc3_main:5.event.6.description" : "Today, I found a small well by the side of the road.  Deciding I could use all the luck I could get, I approached and dropped a coin inside.  A second later, I was hit in the head by something.  I rubbed the sore spot on the top of my skull, bent down to pick up the object that hit me and discovered it was the coin I just dropped into the well.  I glanced up at the sky just in time se see a dark cloud of something descending upon me.  I jumped out of the way as hundreds of Gold fell on the ground in the spot I had been standing.\n\nAmazed by this phenomenon, many of the other Wizards tried throwing their own coins inside the well, but nothing happened.  \n",
	"map.hc3_main:5.event.7.description" : "Reamus brought me a report this morning from the troops we left in the Plane of Fire to control the territory we conquered.  They have learned that the Lord of Fire has enslaved the great Phoenixes and forces them to fight for him, or else he'll destroy the places where the Phoenixes have been born since the beginning of time.\n\nAs I read this report, I clenched my fist around my staff.  The Elemental Lords were no different than the Wizards who once enslaved my people.  To make matters worse, I sat here looking and acting exactly like the bottom-feeders who nearly destroyed my people!\n",
	"map.hc3_main:5.event.8.description" : "I called a meeting of my top advisors this morning.  The Gremlins brought a table out into the middle of camp.  Usually, these meetings were held in private.  Much of what a Wizard does is done in secrecy and I was determined to hold on to at least a small portion of my real identity.  I could tell the Wizards were uncomfortable as a crowd of Gremlins and Mages gathered.\n\n\"We have a more urgent matter to deal with,\" I said sternly.  \"We must abandon our search for the Magic Elementals!\"\n\n\"But why?\" Hemoross said.\n\n\"Because I say so!  Because the Phoenixes are trapped on the Plane of Fire, slaves to the Fire Lord.  As long as I live, I will not allow any creature to be slave to another!\"\n\nThe Mages muttered to each other while some of my advisors protested all at once.\n\nCalmly, Reamus stood and said, \"Lord Tarnum, if we pull back from the Plane of Magic now, the Magic Elementals will be forced to join one of the Elemental Lords.  Then we'll be at a disadvantage.\"\n\nI glared at Reamus and the others.  Of course, they didn't care about the enslaved Phoenixes.  They are the descendents of the same Wizards who enslaved the Barbarians.\n\n\"I will not abandon the Phoenixes!\"\n\n\"I'm not asking that, Lord Tarnum, only that we finish what we do here first!\"\n\n\"No!  I am the commander here.  In a few days, I want to know how long it will take for use to return to the Plane of Fire!\" ",
	"map.hc3_main:5.event.9.description" : "I heard the shouts soon after I retired to my tent for the night, and among the angry words I caught my name.  So, I slipped out the rear of my tent and raced among the shadows toward source of commotion - Reamus's tent.\n\n\"Filthy, thuggish lout!\" said Hemoross.\n\n\"Watch your voice!\" Reamus said.\n\n\"I don't care any longer!  He's a brute, not a real Wizard.  What was King Magnus thinking making him our leader?\"\n\n\"Magnus must've had his reasons.\"\n\n\"You weren't with us then, Reamus.  He's a thug.  Wouldn't even let us build a Mage Guild for the longest time, and I swear he was afraid of magic - like some stupid Barbarian.\"\n\n\"You're being foolish now, Hemoross.  He's as powerful as any Wizard I've met,\" Reamus said.  I could tell the man was attempting to calm Hemoross down.\n\n\"Just look at him!  He's no Wizard!  He's as big as any Barbarian, and I've even heard him pray to the Ancestors - those are the gods of the Barbarians, I've looked it up.  And now he wants to leave the Plane of Magic and save some silly Phoenixes.  This hypocrite!  Barbarians are the biggest slavers around!\"\n\nI had heard enough.  I could see Hemoross's shadow pacing on the other side of the tent cloth, so I punched my hand straight through and grabbed the man by his collar.  Hemoross squealed as I dragged him through the torn tent and through him on the ground.\n\nI wanted to smash his skull in, but I just stared at the man cowering at my feet.  I swallowed my anger and stormed off without another word.  I could tell by the expressions on everyone's faces that they all knew just how close Hemoross came to dying.\n",

Few have trusted my abilities before, being related to the King may have its perks, but no one ever believes you earned your position with your own skills.\"\n\n\"Yes, well, I really just wanted to get you out of my hair,\" I said.\n\nBarsolar smiled at my honesty and said, \"My thanks for your confidence, Lord Tarnish!\"\n\nI laughed.  Now, that's how the game of insults is played!\n\n\"See you later, Boar's-Molar!\" I called as the Wizard left my tent.  I could hear the man's hearty laughter as he walked away.",

A secret entrance to their Conflux?\" I say.\n\n\"No, but while in the south of their region, he was able to learn how to summon Fire and Earth Elementals.  He claims the ones who taught him are in hiding, so search every inch of the south if you want to find them.  I suggest you do so - we'll need that kind of power against the Elemental Lords.\"\n",

When I arrived, I found Reamus, half-dressed, trying to hold a Water Elemental back from a Fire Elemental.\n\n\"What's going on here?\" I yelled.  Everyone fell silent.  After countless years as a military leader, I've learned to cast my voice in such a way as to command attention.\n\n\"Reamus, what's is this?\" I said.\n\nThe Wizard waved his hand at a group of Fire Elementals and said, \"They're trying to defect from the Fire Lord's army, but the Water Elementals don't trust them.\"\n\n\"How can we?  They're Fire - they serve the stinking Fire Lord!  They're assassins!\" said a Water Elemental.\n\nI stared at the Fire Elementals, but it was impossible to determine anything from their fiery expressions.  They had been part of the enemy - it would be foolish to accept them into my own forces without being suspicious.\n\nBut before I could make my decision, Barsolar approached hurriedly.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Lord Tarnum,\" Barsolar said, \"But in my early report I was going to give you some good news.  Apparently, some of the Fire Elementals are leaving the Fire Lord's army because he's been gone for quite a while.\"\n\n\"Yes!\" shouted one of the Fire Elementals.  \"He's a cruel one, he is!\"\n\nI had an easier solution, and immediately summoned the leader of the Psychic Elementals.\n\n\"Tell me if these Fire Elementals truly want to join my forces, or do they have something else in mind?\" I asked the Psychic Elemental.\n\nTHEY ARE AFRAID THEIR MASTER WILL LOSE, SO THEY HOPE TO JOIN YOU, WHO THEY CALL \"MASTER OF ALL ELEMENTS\".\n\nWell, they were cowards, not deserters.  Still, I could use every soldier I could get.",

But the Elemental Lords are going to start their war soon, and I need to be there before too many lives are lost.\n\nReamus will begin construction with the help of Ponific, the Golem Master.

Was it worth this?\" I said, shaking the cage.\n\n\"Barbarians despise Wizards!  Why would one try to help us?\"\n\n\"As punishment, Hemoross,\" I said.\n\nHemoross really wasn't a bad person, just confused - as I had been.  The Ancestors gave me a second chance.  Perhaps I could give Hemoross one as well.\n\n\"I'm going to suggest to Magnus that you be given a promotion.  When this is all over, I'll use whatever power I have to have you named Peace Ambassador to the Barbarian lands,\" I said.\n\nAt first, Hemoross would consider such a promotion a punishment as well, but I could only hope that someday he would learn the same lessons I have learned here.",

He's a courageous man, one of the bravest you've got, and he deserves it.

Once this is over, they are going to remove that information from the minds of those who've learned it,\" I said firmly.\n\nThe power of the Elements was too great a temptation for the people of this world.  I had already made a deal with the Magic Elementals to make the secrets of the Conflux disappear as well - forever.  Once the Elemental Lords were defeated, they would never be heard from again.

This man was immortal, and I wanted to know why.\n\n\"You're immortal,\" I said.\n\n\"Of course, but not in the same way as you,\" Magnus said.  \"I first found out I was immortal when one of your Behemoths killed me.

Since then, I have heard stories about you but nothing very substantial.  I knew some day our paths would cross again, especially when I became King of Bracada.  I used to hate you, Tarnum, the Barbarian King, but time has a way of making you forget.  Now, if you can manage to defeat these Elemental Lords, I will consider us even - perhaps even brothers,\" Magnus said with a wide smile.\n\nUnfortunately, I had no interest in being this man's friend.  He had a cold arrogance that was worse than anything Barsolar had ever been.  He seemed inhuman.

I just learned that the spy you sent to watch Captain Valita is dead.  There was an ambush last night, and although Valita and her men fought off the enemy, your spy was slain.\"\n\nI stood, clenched my fists at my side.  I wasn't really upset that the spy was dead - that's war.  But Aspen acted like he had caught me doing something wrong.\n\n\"How did you know about my spy?\" I said.\n\n\"You may be an Immortal, Tarnum, but you're an infant when it comes to spying.  When selecting a spy, if you didn't want me to know about it you should've picked someone outside your army,\" Aspen said.\n\n\"You're an advisor, Aspen.  Not a teacher!  I don't care about your spying and treachery.  In fact, it disgusts me!  Show me the enemy and let me defeat them!\" I said, the Barbarian in me coming out.\n\n\"The enemy doesn't always fight for the other side, Tarnum.

I'll find another advisor,\" I said.\n\nAspen tried to pull away, but my grip was too tight.  He winced and I realized I was being too tough.  I let go.\n\nAspen rubbed the place where I held him, and said, \"Spies, Tarnum.  You know, that business you want nothing to do with?  I'm talking about spies.  I am not the only one who practices such strategies.\"\n\n\"You're saying we have a spy in our midst?\"\n\n\"I don't know for sure, but haven't you noticed we've had far more ambushes lately than ever before.  It's as if the enemy knows where to look for our troops.  Now, it could be a coincidence because I have been unable to find any factual evidence.  Or our spy is very good at covering their tracks.\"\n\n\"But you have a suspect,\" I said.  Aspen wouldn't be mentioning all this if all he had was a hunch.  Then I thought back to the recent increase of ambushes.  What changed?  Then I knew.\n\n\"You think Captain Valita is the spy!\"\n\nAspen nodded his head and said, \"But I will not accuse her until I have the evidence.\"\n\nI turned my back on my advisor and said, \"You're wrong about this, Aspen.\"\n\nI didn't have any evidence either, but I was going to get it.",

It's confidence!  You have the same confidence in your battle skills.  You have been victorious so many times that I'd wager the thought of losing doesn't even enter your head.  Well, I have been right so many times that I have stopped considering the possibility that I might be wrong.\"\n\nI rolled my eyes and immediately removed myself from my advisor's presence, but later I thought about Aspen's words.  There was a time when I did consider myself incapable of losing a battle.  In the end, I was wrong, but it took a sword in the gut to teach me that lesson.\n\nAnd even now, I realize that I hadn't considered the possibility that I might lose my fight against Mutare.  If she gains control of all the world's Dragons, how could I possibly win?",

I don't have the luxury of lounging about and doin' nothing all day.\"\n\n\"No, just a quick question.  I was wondering what you could tell me about Captain Valita.  Do you know her well?\"\n\nThe Dwarf's expression turned suspicious.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"She's one of my captains, and she talks very little.  I'm curious.  I like to know the people I command,\" I said.\n\n\"You don't come around asking about me,\" Kurbon said.  He had me there.\n\n\"Besides,\" Kurbon continued, \"she's a good Ranger.  One of the best.  That's all you should care about!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.  This hadn't gone as I expected, so I ended it.  One thing was for sure though.

I thought you would want to see it, although I could summarize it for you.  It's very interesting!\" Aspen said.\n\nI waited for the advisor to explain.\n\n\"The Elf King suffered a great loss recently.  Nearly three hundred Elves were killed in an ambush composed primarily of Dragons - Red, Black, and Rust.  The odd fact about the ambush is, these men - Sharpshooters - were experts at camouflage.  They know better than anyone how to stay hidden.  I wonder how the Dragon Queen knew where they would be?\"\n\n\"Just say it, Aspen.  I dislike word games,\" I said.\n\n\"It's further proof that a spy is feeding information to Nighon.  I'm certain of it!\" Aspen said.\n\n\"You may be right, but do you have any evidence about the identity of this traitor?\"\n\nAspen shook his head, dropped the letter into my hand.\n\n\"Not yet,\" he promised.  \"But I think we both have an idea, don't we?\"\n\nI refused to answer.",

One of the workers handed me a small keg of ale so that I could take the first drink, but I handed it to Kurbon instead.\n\n\"He's the Master of Supplies here,\" I said, \"I'm just a worker like you.\"\n\nKurbon took a long gulp from the keg, then turned it over to me.  By the time everyone had a drink, our sweat had dried and we pulled on our shirts once again.\n\nBefore I left, I said, \"Feel free to invite me to join you the next time, Kurbon.

It reminds me of the days when I used to work from sunrise to dark.\"\n\n\"When did you do that?\" Kurbon said.\n\n\"Long time ago, before you were born.\"\n\n\"So, you are blessed with immortality, as they say?\"\n\n\"More like a curse,\" I said with a frown.\n\nKurbon wanted to know how I, a human, came to be so long-lived, but I couldn't bring myself to tell that story - not again.  The Dwarf waited a long time in silence before he realized I wasn't going to share my tale.\n\nKurbon took one last drink, and said, \"Hard work is good for the soul...\"\n\n\"...but ale is better,\" I said, completing the Dwarven proverb.",

MY men!\"\n\nI sat back in my chair, and I noticed that Valita was looking at me now, trying to determine my reaction to her confession.  She saw something in my eyes that surprised her.

No one can expect to stand up to torture for that long - especially in the skilled hands of the Demons and Devils.\"\n\n\"But...\"\n\n\"No!  I know something of shame, Valita.

What are you ashamed about?\"\n\nI had promised to tell her, but could I really explain where I came from and why I, a human, was immortal?\n\n\"To put it simply, I killed many, many people.  I believed I was right, and that anything I did in the name of my goal was right as well.\"\n\n\"Innocents died?\" she asked hesitantly.\n\n\"More than I care to think about,\" I said, \"including one of my own sisters.\"\n\n\"Your sister?  How do you live with yourself?\"\n\nI don't think Valita meant for her question to sound so harsh, but her words still bit deep into my soul.\n\n\"I have hope that some day I can make things right again,\" I said.\n\nValita sat in silence for some time, and then she stood and placed a comforting hand on my shoulder.  I realized that not only do I understand her pain, but now there was someone who understood mine.  It felt good, and I didn't want her to take that hand away.\n\nBut she did.

It's in some kind of odd code, but codes are like puzzles to me - and I'm the best at solving puzzles in all of AvLee!\"\n\nThen Aspen turned to the Harpy and slapped her hard across the face.\n\n\"Tell him what you told me,\" the Elf demanded.\n\nThe Harpy said, \"I pick up the note is all I do!  I fly in at night, pick up the note from an arrow in the top of the tree, and take it back to my master.  That's all I do - I carry things!\"\n\n\"And the arrow - what did it look like?\"\n\n\"An Elven arrow, with black and green feathers,\" the Harpy said immediately.\n\nI clenched my fists because I immediately knew what those colors meant.  Those were the colors Valita used on her arrows.\n\nI glared at the scouts and said, \"Take the Harpy to my tent.  I will interrogate her myself.\"\n\nThen to Aspen, I said, \"Break the code.

Only commanders are allowed their own colors.\"\n\nThen Kurbon realized what colors I was asking about.\n\n\"This is about Valita, isn't it?  What's wrong?\" he asked.\n\n\"Aspen thinks he's finally uncovered his spy,\" I said.  I left, knowing already that I had said too much.  If Valita was the spy, she would soon find out that Aspen was close to proving it.\n\nBut I didn't care.\n\nWhen I got back to my tent, however, I noticed the chessboard sitting on my strategy table.  I had scheduled a game with Aspen, but I didn't feel much like playing anymore.  Then I got to thinking about the strategies I had been using, about the one Valita has been teaching me, and even about some of the ones I've learned from Aspen.\n\nAnd then I realized that I hadn't been considering all the pieces in this spy game I have been dragged into.",

It's coded - unreadable - and according to Aspen very difficult to break.\"\n\n\"And the other paper?\" Valita asked.\n\n\"A translation, completed this morning by Aspen, although no one knows yet that he has broken the code.\"\n\nI stood up and approached Valita, handing her the notes.  She looked at them briefly, then back to me.\n\n\"Do you believe I am a spy?\" she asked softly.\n\nI could tell by her expression that she already knew suspicion had been cast her way.\n\nBut I leaned forward and placed my lips on hers, finding them thin but extremely soft and warm.  She didn't pull away as the part of me that didn't want to be hurt had hoped.  Instead, she kissed me back, and placed a hand on my hip.\n\nShe asked again, \"Do you think I am the spy?\"\n\n\"No, I wouldn't kiss a spy,\" I said.  \"I think I've been watching the queen while my enemy sneaks his bishop in for checkmate.\"\n\n\"What?\" Valita asked, but I didn't want to explain right now.\n\nI kissed her again.",

It was in code, but Aspen had already made notes in the margin.  I read them quickly.\n\n\"This isn't from the spy?\" I said.\n\n\"No, it's TO the spy,\" Aspen said with a big, gloating grin.  He looked directly at Valita, who was standing next to me.  Many of the other soldiers were already gathering around us.\n\n\"You've translated it so quickly?\" I said.\n\n\"Yes, I know the code by heart,\" Aspen said.  \"Mutare will have no more secrets!\"\n\n\"And who's the spy?\"\n\n\"It's...\"\n\nThe arrow nicked my shoulder on its way into Aspen's chest.

It provided me just enough cover.\n\nThe Minotaurs stopped in the middle of the clearing as they heard a hissing sound cutting the night air.  They looked up.  Something blocked out the stars in the sky, and then hundreds of arrows rained down on them.  My archers had fired from extreme range.

We killed all of the second wave too, but at the cost of the last of our Dragons.

He even gave himself a name - Vorr,\" said Addar.\n\nKrewlod was a familiar name.  It was the new name given to my homeland.  Could this ancient Barbarian King have been me?  Could my people be modeling their brutality after my own actions?\n\nI dismissed the shaman, unable to continue this conversation right now.",

With an axe in his hand, there was no force that could stand in his way.  He had the strength of thirty men, and whenever he commanded an army victory was certain.  Vorr also enjoyed the adoration of his people - perhaps too much.\n\n\"For years they praised him and gave him their love, until one year they grew bored.  They turned their interests toward a young man who could run and swim faster and farther than any other.  Vorr grew angry and jealous and challenged this young man to a race around the world.  Granted, Vorr was very strong, but his power was on the battlefield.  For a year and a day the two raced around the world, shoulder-to-shoulder the entire way until...\"\n\n\"What?\" I said.\n\n\"Just before they reached the finish line, the young runner pulled out in front.  Vorr knew he had lost, so, he pulled out his axe and lopped off the young man's head right in front of everyone.  A shameful end.\"\n\n\"What happened to Vorr?\"\n\n\"He tried to win back his people's love by forcing them.  He conquered them and became a much unloved king.  He died bitter and old, and in his bed.\"\n\nI didn't see how this Vorr could possibly be one of the Ancestors.  Perhaps the name is a coincidence.",

Since shaman didn't till their own fields, or raise their own sheep, they lived solely from the generosity of those who sought their wisdom.  I reached into a sack on my hip, removed a ceramic bottle, and pulled the stopper out with my teeth.\n\n\"Try it,\" I said.\n\nWern took a cautious sip.  His eyebrows perked up as he recognized the strong spirits within, then he took a long swallow.\n\n\"I'll think on this matter, Tarnum,\" Wern said.  He took another swallow.

Now, return in a few days and let me meditate on...\"\n\nWern never finished his sentence because my hand closed around his scrawny throat.\n\n\"No, you'll answer me now, old man!\" I said.\n\nWhen I let go, Wern was more cooperative.  Wern's been known to keep people waiting for an answer for months.  If I hadn't shown the shaman I was serious, I would never learn anything.\n\n\"Ah, yes, you wanted to know where the Mad Ancestor could've gone.  I tried to talk to the spirits, but they are quiet.  Strange.  It worries me!\"\n\n\"Yes, I know that already, but where could Vorr have gone?\"\n\n\"Without the guidance of the Ancestors, I can not say,\" Wern said.\n\nIn truth, none of us are whole without the Ancestors.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I said, standing.

But you don't know Skizzik's problem.  You don't know, he got himself many people mad at him.  All because I left the stupid door open!  Silly to me, it is!\"\n\n\"What door?\"\n\n\"To the cell where the big guy keeps the shiny people,\" said the Familiar.

You know where the Ancestors are?\"\n\n\"Me know.\"\n\nAgain, I waited, but when I was certain Skizzik wouldn't respond I opened my mouth to speak.\n\n\"I know, I know,\" Skizzik interrupted.  \"You want to know, don't you!\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n",

He was one of the prison workers - the water bearer.  Shortly after the arrival of the Ancestors, however, he left the door open briefly.  The Ancestors didn't escape, but the Demons and things were really upset with him.  Something about them being able to call for help, but Skizzik swears the Fiery Moon has nothing but Demons and things on it.\n\nPerhaps the call that urged me to save the World Tree had been the cry the Demons were talking about.  If that was so, then I finally understand why the Ancestors have been so quiet.\n\nSo, when the Demons found out about Skizzik's mistake, they tried to kill him, but the Familiar managed to escape.

Wherever they went, I imagined Skizzik's kind turning every world into a copy of this Fiery Moon.\n\nAnd my world was certainly next.  Vorr's appetite for destruction was incredible - perhaps greater even than a Demon's - and now he has attracted these Demons to my world.\n\nI raised my sword above these forgotten warriors and swore, \"As long as blood pumps through my body, I swear my world will not become like this one!\"",

The stench of unwashed bodies was nauseating, and the sight of their frail frames was heartbreaking.\n\nEven my people, the Barbarians, had not suffered like this under the cruel domination of the Wizards of Bracaduun.  I do not think these Erathians are normally evil.  They simply have a leader right now who is insane, but that doesn't explain why everyone else allows this brutality to continue.\n\nPerhaps when some creature has been a slave for a very long time, people cease to see them as anything but a tool?",

Onsten punished him for attempting to escape by chopping off his arms and legs and cauterizing the wounds.  Then the poor Gnoll was abandoned by the side of the road where we would find him.  Instead of execution, this Gnoll was allowed to live for a few days longer simply to cast fear into the other escaped slaves.\n\n\"Give him a good burial,\" I commanded.\n\nBut I could see in the eyes of my troops that they feared they would end up the same way.",

	"map.hc7_main:2.event.5.description" : "Who can lead the Mudlanders when I am gone?\n\nThat is the question that was on my every thought until I saw the young warrior, Droglo.  He was what they call a 'swamp-boy', a human raised in the swamp among the creatures.  Although not a slave himself, he had spent much of his life battling the Erathians.\n\nBut it wasn't his resourcefulness, or his battle skills, or even his charisma that convinced me he would be an excellent leader of the Mudlanders.  It was his compassion.\n\nSome Gnolls brought Droglo to my camp as a prisoner.  The Gnolls had been responsible for some Erathian captives when the boy released them, so they brought me Droglo instead.\n\nWhen I asked the boy why he let the prisoners free, Droglo said, \"Because they were innocent.  I heard the Gnolls accusing them of slaughtering some children, but I know that is not true.  I already killed the thugs responsible for that crime!\"\n\n\"Don't you think they are still guilty of other crimes?  For instance, slavery?\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, I don't think they chose to lock our people up.  There've been Mudlander slaves here before they were born.  The way I see it, it's that Mad King's fault and the fault of his father and his father before that.  Those soldiers held slaves, same as we Mudlanders work for our masters.  It's how things are!\"\n\nThat's when I knew Droglo would be the perfect leader for these Mudlanders.  But first, I had to turn him into something more than a simple 'swamp-boy'.",
	"map.hc7_main:2.event.6.description" : "Baron Paglon realizes that he is trapped.  There is nowhere to run, and there will be no more help from Mad King Gryphonheart.  So, Paglon has offered me a deal - half his wealth if I let him go free.\n\nI have refused.  Paglon was worse even than Lord Onsten because he supported and even encouraged the Rogues who have been roaming the countryside gathering the heads of escaped slaves.  Perhaps with Paglon out of the way, some of the murders will stop.  Then who will pay the bounty?",
	"map.hc7_main:2.event.7.description" : "Brellick and a few other Gnolls approached me early this morning, but it wasn't Brellick who spoke to me.  One of the other soldiers stepped nervously forward.\n\n\"Sir, I have bad news,\" the Gnoll stammered.\n\nI looked at Brellick and the others.  They were afraid of me, or perhaps it was my response they feared?  When did I get a reputation for cruelty?  Then I recalled that all these Gnolls had been slaves just a few short months ago.  Whenever they had to report bad news to their masters, they were probably whipped for it.  No wonder they expect me to respond similarly.\n\n\"What is it?\" I asked.\n\n\"We,\" the Gnoll began, glancing at Brellick and the others for support, \"were checking the supplies before we began the march today.  Practically an entire wagon is missing!\"\n\n\"Really?  Are you sure?\" I asked calmly.  Wagons didn't just disappear, but I didn't want to give my own troops reason to fear me, so I restrained my shock.\n\n\"We think deserters stole the resources,\" Brellick said.\n\n\"Deserters?  How many?\"\n\n\"Nearly a dozen.  I'm sad to say they are Gnolls, sir.\"\n\nWell, the desertions had begun.  I'm not surprised, considering the odds against us.  The true problem is how to deal with it.  Normally, swift and firm punishment would scare the rest of the soldiers straight, but if I responded with brutality these Gnolls would simply see me as another slavemaster.\n\n\"Send a search party after the deserters, but don't go out of your way.  I can't force them to fight, nor do I want to.\"\n\nBrellick nodded and turned to leave.\n\n\"One more thing,\" I said.  \"Order the search party to capture the deserters.  Don't kill them!  Don't harm them in any way.\"",

Some even bring cartloads of their trophies!\n\nIt's all too familiar!\n\n\"By the Ancestors!  Give me just a few seconds with this scum!\" I shout in a moment of weakness and rage.\n\nAs I look at my troops, I can tell my fury is catching.  If I don't control it soon, I'll have an army of maniacs thirsting for blood as I did so long ago when I conquered Bracaduun.\n\nLater, in my tent, the wise woman, Adamina, came to talk to me.\n\n\"Do you think destroying our enemy will save us?\" she asked.\n\nI could tell by her suspicious tone that she was up to something.\n\n\"It's not the only way,\" I admitted, \"If we don't find a home and bind together as a community, we'll forever be weak.  If not the Erathians, then someone else will walk in and enslave us.\"\n\n\"A wise choice, but I seem to recall from the ancient stories a great and horrible leader of the Barbarians who made another choice,\" Adamina said.\n\nSo, she suspected I wasn't who I said I was, but how much did she know?\n\n\"He was wrong!  If we can't learn from history, then we are doomed to repeat it, aren't we?\" I said.\n\nAdamina nodded.  There was nothing more to say.",

Because he knows that Niven has the support of all the nobility and he could be used to raise Erathia against him,\" the noble said.\n\nI've seen Niven's compassion toward slaves first hand.  He's the first Erathian I've faced that hasn't slaughtered every escaped slave he can find.  He's even removed the bounty on slave heads, replacing it with a single bounty for me instead.  A smart move, trying to cut the head off the snake.\n\n\"I still don't know what this has to do with me,\" I said.  What else was this noble willing to reveal?\n\n\"Please don't kill the Prince!

If I didn't know better, I would think they were brothers.\n\nToday, Droglo left early to tend to a minor cut on his shoulder, so I stepped in to give the Prince some lessons.\n\n\"You're almost as fast as Droglo and absolutely more skilled, but still you lose to him half the time.  Do you know why?\" I asked.\n\n\"He surprises me,\" Niven said between heavy breaths.  \"He's always doing things I don't expect, like pretending to fall.\"\n\n\"That's part of it, yes.  Droglo fights by instinct, but years of training have made you stiff, predictable.  I can almost hear you going over your drills while you fight.  You need to relax and be more creative.  Enjoy yourself!\"\n\nNiven lowered his sword, stared at me as if I had said something unreasonable.\n\n\"This is battle!  How can I enjoy myself?\"\n\n\"I don't mean enjoy the kill.  I mean enjoy the dance,\" I said.\n\n\"You don't talk like a Mudlander,\" Niven said.  \"You don't look like one either.  Sure, you dress like one, but your size, your obvious power, even your features - none of that is like any Mudlander I have seen.  More Erathian, if you ask me.\"\n\nActually, my features were Barbarian, but Niven didn't know that his own people, the Erathians, had a significant amount of Barbarian blood running through their veins.\n\n\"I'm sure you've heard of Erathian nobles taking slaves as mistresses,\" I explained.\n\nNiven seemed to accept this lie and we returned to the sword practice.  This time, every time Niven fell into his usual stiff routine, I gave him a nick to remind him to relax.  Soon he was covered in sores.",

He was so unlike his father - compassionate, honourable.  He would make a great King.\n\nI found him sulking this morning after we picked up some new escaped slaves, half of which weren't expected to survive the day.  I approached and placed a hand on the young man's shoulder.\n\n\"I suspected,\" Niven said.  \"All these years, I suspected something was wrong but I was too afraid to find out what it was.  I've known all along.\"\n\n\"Known what?\"\n\n\"That my father is insane.  Everyone knows, but we're all too afraid of him to do anything about it.  Do you know why I like Droglo so much?\"\n\n\"No, why?\" I asked.\n\n\"Because my own brother and I are enemies, and it is my father's fault.  When I was six and my brother five, he brought us together and said, 'One of you is going to be King some day.  You want to know which one?  The one who kills the other first, that's who!'  Then he laughed.  He thought it was funny!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said.  It was a miracle Niven turned out the way he was, considering the maniac he had for a father.\n\n\"Is my blood cursed?\" Niven said, near tears.\n\nI grabbed his shoulders firmly and forced him to stare into my eyes.\n\n\"Don't ever think that!  Haven't you ever heard the name of Rion Gryphonheart, first of your line?  Or how about his daughter, Allison?  They were two of the fairest, greatest leaders I have ever...heard of!\"\n\nI almost said, 'met'.\n\n\"If anything,\" I continued, \"your bloodline is blessed with heroes brave enough to do whatever it takes to protect their people.

But I insisted that was not an option.\n\nThen Niven said, \"No.  You must make the trade!\"\n\n\"But Niven, you can't!\" Droglo said.  \"You're on our side now.\"\n\n\"I know, and that won't change, but we can't let those women die.  You have to turn me over to Rambert.  I want you to!\"\n\nIt would be risky, especially for Niven.  His father was likely to execute him simply because he had spent so long in my hands.  But the boy was right.  Niven had made the decision I was afraid to make.\n\n\"We'll make the trade,\" I said, \"but Rambert may not live to appreciate it.\"\n\nWhat I had in mind would be risky for us as well, but great victories required great risk.",

Niven's right eye was swollen shut and both lips were split down the middle.\n\n\"How's the eye?\"\n\n\"Feels like you punched it out the back of my skull,\" Niven said.  He smiled, winced as one of his lips began to bleed again.\n\n\"Are you sure you want to do this, Prince?  We could find another way,\" I said.\n\n\"There is no other way.\"\n\nI pushed my hand through the narrow bars and shook the boy's hand.\n\n\"If you were my son, I'd tell you that I am very proud of you,\" I said.\n\nNiven fought back the tears building in his eyes.\n\n\"We'll send word soon as the wisewomen are safe,\" Niven said.\n\n\"We'll be ready.

I guess moving your army closer to his land scared him, or perhaps Rambert underestimated the determination of the Mudlanders.  Still, Rambert tried to betray us.  We Erathians have forgotten the honesty and honour that made us great!\n\nBut we broke the ambush, thanks mostly to Droglo's Wyverns.  Sadly, I must report that brave Brellick fell to Earl Rambert's blade.  At this sight, I escaped from my cage, picked up a weapon, and put an end to the treacherous noble.  You would have been proud of me.  For the first time in my life, I enjoyed the dance!\n\nNow that the wisewomen are safe, you are free to attack the late Earl Rambert's forces.  Droglo and the others will meet you at the arranged spot, but I will not be with them.  I feel I can be of greater help by returning to Erathia to speak with those nobles who are dissatisfied with my father's rule.  If I can turn them against my father, then not only will the Mudlanders finally be safe but Erathia will have a chance to return to its former greatness.\n\nI cannot thank you enough for opening my eyes to the pain of the Mudlanders.  I only hope that I have the courage to end that pain forever!\n\nYour Friend,\n\nPrince Niven of Erathia\"\n\nI folded the letter and, as if Niven were right next to me, I said, \"You have the courage of other Gryphonhearts I have known.

The only good news is your father has lost his support from home.  He's alone, except for the thieves and mercenaries he's been hiring.

By the time he slipped into Niven's tent, Droglo had already spotted him.\n\nAs Niven described it, the Monk drew a long blade from the folds of his robes but before he could attack, Droglo jumped on the killer's back and dragged him to the ground.

That was the only way to break an ambush - charge directly at them.\n\nAfter the initial shock, I snapped off the shaft of the arrow in case the head was barbed and chased after Droglo to make sure the boy didn't get into trouble.  I came to the spot where most of the Rogues had been killed, but there was no sign of Droglo.\n\nTo one of the Gnolls, I demanded, \"Where is Droglo?\"\n\n\"He went running off after one of them who escaped.

Abandoned for who knows how many years, nature had reclaimed the land.  But what I thought had been a mound turned out to be the cracked head and torso of a giant statue of a man.  It had fallen on its side.  Vines hugged it tightly like a dying child.\n\nDroglo turned slowly to stare at me.\n\n\"It's you!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.",
	"map.hc7_main:7.event.8.description" : "\"Let me explain,\" I said, entering Droglo's tent.\n\nThe boy hadn't said a word to me since we saw the statue yesterday.  I knew he had asked Adamina about the statue, and perhaps about the past as well.\n\nHow much did Droglo know?  Did he know that the Barbarian Tyrant once dominated this land and its people?  Did he know that, in his arrogance, the Barbarian Tyrant had statues of himself erected all over the continent?  Did he know that I had been the Barbarian Tyrant?\n\n\"Explain?\" Droglo asked.  \"Can you explain why you have the face of the Tyrant?  I don't see how.  You can't be the Tyrant - he's been dead for a very long time.  So, it must be coincidence, right?\"\n\nI could tell by the tears in Droglo's eyes that he didn't believe his own words.\n\n\"That's right,\" I said.  If Droglo didn't want to talk about it, I had to accept that, but he deserved some kind of explanation.\n\nI asked, \"If a man - a King - made many terrible mistakes, do you think he should have the chance to redeem himself?\"\n\n\"Depends on the man, I think,\" Droglo said.  \"Take Mad King Gryphonheart, for instance.  His crimes are too great!  He deserves only to rot in a pit for all eternity!\"\n\nIf only the boy knew Gryphonheart's crimes were nothing compared to my own.\n\n\"Well, if that man got the chance to make things right, he would probably look for someone who was nothing like he used to be - someone fair and good - to take over when he was gone.\"\n\nI left the tent knowing that this revolt would be over soon and I would never see Droglo again.  But I smiled.  Erathia was in good hands with Niven as their King, and Droglo would protect the people of Tatalia for as long as he lived.\n\nAnd one day soon that statue of the Barbarian Tyrant would vanish into the swamp forever.

It's no surprised the little creatures have learned to move around so quickly.  I admit, over the years, I have probably killed hundreds of Troglodytes, but now that I lead them I only want to protect them from their own allies.\n\nWhen a pair of Harpies started harassing a Troglodyte carrying some food to its friends, I jumped in and grabbed the winged women by their scrawny throats.  I knew I couldn't show any weakness around here or someone would try to kill me and take over my leadership.  Nor could I show compassion for another.\n\nSo, I kicked the Troglodyte to the ground and threw the Harpies up against the nearest tunnel wall.\n\n\"Did I say you could fight amongst each other?  Did I?\" I shouted at the top of my lungs.  I made sure my entire army could hear.\n\nThe Troglodyte cowered as I drew the spiked mace from my belt.  The Harpies tried to slink away.  It was at that moment that I knew I had to make an example here and now or more of these creatures would die.\n\nI jumped on the Harpies.  With one hand, I tore off a wing.

In typical Nighon fashion, the Medusa was testing my strength as the leader and when I failed she would replace me.\n\n\"You are Overlord no longer,\" the Medusa said.  \"I rule now!\"\n\nI tried to lift my mace to defend myself, but my arms were going numb.

If I let this Barbarian talk to me in that way, the Beholders would sense a weakness.  As much as I disliked it, I still needed them and my troops.\n\nSo, I cleared the distance to the messenger in a single jump and broke his nose.  While he was stunned, I took away the Barbarian's weapon and broke his arm with the blunt end of the axe.  Then I threw the Barbarian outside the tent where everyone could see.\n\n\"Go tell that woman that I do what I wish!  I'm not like Kilgor, cowering behind his females when something has to be done.

I'm afraid if I don't learn the location of the Sword of Frost soon, I will never have the chance to stop Gelu.\n\n\"No torture!\" I said.  \"At least, not yet.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" Kilkik said.\n\nHe had a right to be confused.  I have allowed torture before, but only because I wasn't part of it.  I didn't know the people.  I didn't have to listen to their screams.  But with Ufretin, a bold hero who deserves better, I couldn't bring myself to allow it.\n\nAnd my reluctance was causing a stir among the troops.  Although I have no proof, I'm certain Kilkik is at least partially behind the increasing disobedience of my army.  Still, my success depends entirely on Ufretin - and he thinks I am his enemy.",

I don't even want it to be found at all!\"\n\nBut Ufretin didn't believe me.  In his eyes, I was a traitor.  I was one of the Nighons now.  How could I convince him otherwise?

I'm not going to tell you anything.\"\n\n\"I came to explain myself - to really explain myself,\" I said.\n\nIt has come to this.  I could think of no other reason why Ufretin would ever speak to me, short of torture, and I wasn't going to resort to that.  Already, I feel I have allowed myself to be dragged too far down by my troops.\n\n\"What is that supposed to mean?\" Ufretin asked.\n\nI looked around to make sure no one was watching.  Then slowly, I pulled my shirt apart to reveal my naked chest.\n\n\"I am immortal, Ufretin.  I am not just long-lived like the Elves and Dragons.  I am immortal - I can't die!\"\n\n\"You're a fool!\"\n\n\"I was a fool once, a cruel one, and I've been paying for my brutality ever since.  I will probably pay for it until the end of time.

How?\"\n\n\"Like I said, I am immortal.\"\n\n\"How?  Why?\" Ufretin asked.  I no longer saw hatred in this man's eyes, but fear.\n\nOver the next hour, I told him a shortened version of my story.  I tried to explain my actions by describing the cruelty of the Wizard-Kings who enslaved my people, but when I described the hundreds of villages I burned to the ground and the thousands of people I slaughtered my excuse seemed weak.  Finally, I told him how I died, and how the Ancestors refused to allow me to enter Paradise.\n\n\"I do what they ask - I am their servant until I can redeem myself.
